the 093’s noise level has been reduced to that of
the Russian Akula-class submarine at 110 decibels.
He states that the 094’s acoustic signature has been
reduced to 120 decibels. According to this report,
this is definitely not equal to that of the Ohio class,
but is on a par with the Los Angeles. There is no additional
information given to evaluate concerning the origins or
comparability of these 'data.'" - Andrew S. Erickson & Lyle J. Goldstein, 2006.

As a reminder, a decibel is: "a unit used to measure the intensity
of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing
it with a given level on a logarithmic scale" - American English in
Oxford dictionary, 2013.

Decibels do not scale linearly. A 3db change is signifies a
doubling power and a change of 10 db signifies the power increasing
by a factor of ten.  Therefore, the 636 Kilo class with an acoustic
signature of 105 decibels is 10 times as loud as the 95 decibel
acoustic signature of the Virginia class submarine.

To provide a point of reference, the following acoustic
signatures are from "Chinese Evaluations of the U.S. Navy Submarine Force"
 and "CHINA’S FUTURE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE FORCE"

Ocean background noise - 90 decibels
Seawolf-class - 95 decibels
Virginia-class - 95 decibels
636 Kilo class - 105 decibels
Akula-class - 110 decibels
Type 093 - 110 decibels
Type 094 - 120 decibels


The Shang has an acoustic signature similar to the original
Russian Akula class boats or roughly equivalent to the original
Los-Angles class submarine, not the 688I (improved Los-Angles class).
Judging from acoustic signatures, the most modern Chinese nuclear
submarines are comparabile to 1970s and 1980s US and Soviet
designs shown on the chart below.


DEEP:

During World War II, American fleet submarines normally operated at a depth of 200 feet,
 though in emergencies they would dive to a depth of 400 feet.

Post-War American submarines, both conventional and nuclear, had improved designs
and were constructed of improved materials [the equivalent of "HY-42"]. These boats
 had normal operating depths of some 700 feet, and a crush depth of 1100 feet.

The Thresher, the first American submarine constructed of HY-80 steel, reportedly
 had a normal operating depth of 1,300 feet, roughly two-thirds the crush depth limit
  imposed by the HY-80 steel.

The Seawolf, the first American submarine constructed of HY-100 steel, is officially
claimed by the Navy to have a normal operating depth of "greater than 800 feet," but based
on the reported operating depth of the Thresher, it may be assumed that the normaly operating
 depth of the Seawolf is roughly double the official figure.

The Soviet Alfa submarines, constructed of titanium, reportedly had an operating depth
of nearly 4,000 feet.
