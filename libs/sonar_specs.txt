AN/BQQ-5[edit]
AN/BQQ-5 sensor suite consists of the AN/BQS-13 spherical sonar array
and AN/UYK-44 computer. The AN/BQQ-5 was developed from the AN/BQQ-2 sonar system.
 The BQS 11, 12, and 13 spherical arrays have 1,241 transducers.
  Also equipped are a 104 hydrophone hull array and two towed arrays:
   the TB-12 (later replaced by the TB-16) and TB-23 or TB-29, of
    which there are multiple variants. There are 5 versions of the AN/BQQ-5 system,
     sequentially identified by letters A-E.

The 688i (Improved) subclass was initially equipped with the AN/BSY-1 SUBACS
submarine advanced combat system that used an AN/BQQ-5E sensor system with
updated computers and interface equipment. Development of the AN/BSY-1 and its
sister the AN/BSY-2 for the Seawolf class was widely reported as one of the
most problematic programs for the Navy, its cost and schedule suffering many setbacks.

A series of conformal passive hydrophones are hard-mounted
to each side of the hull, using the AN/BQR-24 internal processor. The
 system uses FLIT (frequency line integration tracking) which homes
 in on precise narrowband frequencies of sound and, using the Doppler principle,
  can accurately provide firing solutions against very quiet submarines.
  The AN/BQQ-5’s hull array doubled the performance of its predecessors.

AN/BQQ-10[edit]
The AN/BQQ-5 system was replaced by the AN/BQQ-10 system.
 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI),
 designated AN/BQQ-10, is a four-phase program for transforming existing
 submarine sonar systems (AN/BSY-1, AN/BQQ-5, and AN/BQQ-6) from legacy systems
  to a more capable and flexible COTS/Open System Architecture (OSA) and also
  provide the submarine force with a common sonar system. A single A-RCI
   Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP) has as much computing power as the entire
   Los Angeles (SSN-688/688I) submarine fleet combined and will allow
   the development and use of complex algorithms previously beyond the
   reach of legacy processors. The use of COTS/OSA technologies and systems
    will enable rapid periodic updates to both software and hardware.
    COTS-based processors will allow computer power growth at a rate
    commensurate with the commercial industry.[21]

# HS-100
The HS-100 is a compact, long-range, multifunction hull-mounted sonar. Decades of dipping sonar
 experience and expertise have resulted in this slimmed down, dome profile which conforms to the
  hydrodynamic, low-drag bulbous bow shape of a surface warship.
The transducer elements of the HS-100 are constructed from PMN (lead magnesium niobate).
 The mid-frequency (MF) multiplexed hydrophone channels are easily interfaced to an open
  architecture COTS acoustic processor.
The HS-100 uses 32 modern projectors to provide the high source levels necessary
 for long-range detection. The vertical “line” transmit array design produces large
  time-bandwidth wave trains that are not possible with traditional sector scan sonars.
   The lightweight, receive volumetric array comprises a vertical set of receive hydrophone
   staves with embedded ATM digital telemetry processing that eliminates the need for individual sensor cabling, transmit/receive switches and signal conditioning cabinets found in traditional active sonars.
The HS-100 is being developed by L-3 Communications Ocean Systems as a “green” sonar
in that its transmissions do not harm aquatic life such as whales and dolphins

FROM 688 HUNTER/KILLER GAME:

SPHERICAL ARRAY
The spherical array in the bow is used at up to 25 knots and can track broadband
as well as narrowband contacts. Passive detection ranges from 750 Hz
to 2.0 kHz. In active mode, the array transmits and detects at a higher frequency
range of 2.0 kHz to 10 kHz.
The spherical array processes broadband signals better than other arrays.
Bearing accuracy is particularly good. At higher speeds, there is some degradation
of performance because of flow noise caused by the water moving
across the surface of the array. It is not as sensitive to low frequencies, so it’s
not the array of choice for narrowband contacts emitting only low frequencies.



HULL ARRAY
The hull array, also at the bow of the ship, is a linear array that provides low
speed capability to detect low frequency narrowband contacts (50 Hz -to1.0
kHz). As such, its primary use is for classifying targets.


TOWED ARRAY
The towed array—pulled behind the submarine on a long tow cable so it
won’t pick up the submarine’s own machinery noise—is used for both broadband
and narrowband tracking (10 Hz–1.0 kHz). It is used at low to medium
speeds, and is optimized for lower frequencies, making it approximately 20%
more effective in processing signals




The AN/BQQ-5 sonar, the US Navy’s first active/passive digital sonar system, is the
principal sensor system of the US Navy’s ‘Los Angeles’ class nuclear attack submarines.
The AN/BQQ-5 is a digital, multi-beam system employing hull-mounted,
sphere-mounted and towed acoustic hydrophone arrays. The polyethylene-covered
tow cable, which has a maximum length of about 800 m, is 9.5 mm in diameter,
and the array at the end of the cable, where the hydrophones and electronics are
located, is 82.5 mm in diameter. The array is tapered fore and aft to minimise flow
noise. Drag is stated to account for a maximum reduction in speed of 0.5 kts, with
no serious inhibition on submerged manoeuvres and little adverse effect on surface
manoeuvres with the one exception of those entailing going about.
During the late 1970s the US Navy became concerned that the AN/BQQ-5 would
not be able to handle the developing threats and embarked on a programme to
update the capabilities of the system. An improved control display console has
been developed and sonars that have been upgraded with the new consoles are
known as the AN/BQQ-5B. A further modification to the system developed under
this programme is the AN/BQQ-5C(V) Expanded Directional Frequency Analysis and
Recording System (DIFAR), which replaces the original signal processor with the
AN/UYH-1 standard signal processor. The AN/BQQ-5D uses a thin-line array and
utilises some of the technology common to the AN/BSY-1 system. It became operational
in 1988. A contract for the development of the AN/BQQ-5E was awarded in
December 1988. A new thin-line array for passive ranging is to be integrated with
the AN/BQQ-5E, the first of which will go to sea in late 1993.
The US Navy has been developing a thin-line tow array and handling system and
other modifications for the AN/BQQ-5 system (see operational status). The thin-line
towed array, known as the TB-23, forms part of the AN/BSY-1(V) combat suite. It is
a lightweight system that can be reeled into the vessel’s main ballast tank, instead
of being housed on the side of the submarine, and will replace the TB-16 ‘thickline’
array currently employed in the AN/BQQ-5.
The AN/BQQ-5 provides improved detection, tracking and classification of low frequency
data. The latest development also provides processing capability for the
new TB-29 towed array and interfacing to the new fire-control system CCS Mk 2.
The combining of the AN/BQQ-5E, TB-29, and CCS Mk 2 will result in a system
referred to as QE2 that was scheduled for Technical Evaluation in 1993.
The AN/WLR-9A acoustic intercept receiver, produced by Norden, has been successfully
evaluated and forms an integral subsystem of the AN/BQQ-5 and
AN/BQQ-6 on new attack and Trident missile submarines. The subsystem features
a CRT display, a digital readout and a remote unit for the submarine commander. A
‘sensitivity improvement’ kit for the AN/WLR-9A has been developed by Norden
and deliveries to the US Navy are in progress.

NOISE
Three factors contribute to the noise between you and the contact: thermal
layers, sea state, and own ship noise. If the contact is on the opposite side of a
thermal layer, it may appear as a very faint contact (for more information on
thermals, see Sonar & The Ocean Environment, p. 111). The sea state, i.e., the
amount of turbulence caused by weather, has an additional effect. The more
violent the sea state, the more interference over the entire acoustic spectrum.
Finally, your own movement has an adverse effect on your sensors. As speed
increase, array sensitivity decreases. If you go too fast, the arrays will no
longer be able to pick out any sounds from the environment at all. The maximum
speed varies by array: 20 kts for the spherical array, 5 kts for the hull
array, and 25 kts for the towed array.
All that being said, the relative sensitivity of the various arrays can be communicated
through example. The diagram below depicts a submarine listening
to a merchant ship traveling at low speed in a low sea state environment.
If the merchant ship were going faster, the sensor ranges displayed below
would increase; however, if the submarine were below a thermal layer in a
surface duct environment, detection would be cut in half.
